### Background of the project

Let’s start from afar. It is known that some people (in fact, many) have abilities that go beyond what science
has been able to define as the norm. They have many variations and manifestations. One of them is the influence
on the surrounding objects and phenomena without “direct” contact (without touching and commands). It cannot
be called reliably (consistently) proven. However, this is more than likely.

Science tells us that we constantly live in streams of electromagnetic emission of various nature and strength.
The gamma, X-ray and ultraviolet light of the Sun, as well as the radio waves of the WiFi router and NFC
transmitter, are on this list. All of them can influence us. And there is a theory that the opposite effect
is also possible. However, why the theory: electroencephalography is a real medical test of brain activity,
and the hammerhead shark quite realistically searches for its prey in complete darkness.

To put it simply (may physicists and doctors forgive us), brain activity is capable of introducing distortions
into electromagnetic fields, “giving out” itself and its power. And this can be registered. However, we want
to go a little further...

There is an *unverified theory* that perturbations introduced by people (primarily through strong emotions)
into the conditionally uniformly moving (artificial distortions are ignored) emission streams can, among
other things, manifest themselves in “failures” in the operation of the RNG, the principle of action most
of which are based on the registration of these emissions.

**Random number generators** are devices that allow you to form sequences of numbers, each of the next of which
cannot be predicted from the previous ones. “Failures” in work of the RNG lead to a distortion of the probability
distribution in the sequences, which is exactly recorded according to this theory. It says that this is exactly
what happened with some real generators (we are talking, first of all, about casinos where they are widespread)
before the events of September 11, as well as the tsunami of 2004 and 2011.

Let’s decipher: if the generator makes numbers from 1 to 100 with the same probability of occurrence of any
of them (1%), then the above errors “deform” this distribution, causing, f. e., a 3% probability of occurrence
of the number 54. And registration of the obtained values and calculating the average instead of the conditional
standard of 50.5±0.5 will give something like 51.6±0.9 or 49.8±0.7 during a statistically significant period
of time.

This is the theory. And we seem to know how to test it. At the moment, we’ve already developed an application
for Android, which will allow us to conduct an interesting experiment. We’ll try to ***find out some forms
of paranormal activity***. And ***do it in an almost scientific way***. Even if nothing comes of it, this
will also be the result – one else theory will be removed. In any case, we hope for your participation
and support. After all, this absolutely safe test can give completely unpredictable results.

### Operating principle

As you already understood, this is an unusual application. Its task is to ***discover and mathematically
confirm your (or somebody’s, or something’s) ability to influence the surrounding reality not only by actions
and words***. But how does it work?

Using the strength of WiFi signal or the entropy of operating system kernel (“noise” of the processor
and timer, fluctuations in the speed of network packets and core temperature) as an indicator of severe
disturbances in surrounding electromagnetic field, application generates a series of pseudo-random numbers.
Normally, the average value in such series should be close to the middle of range of possible values.
The app will catch and accumulate major deviations from the middle, noting when they occurred. This will
help you understand if you see some paranormal activity right now.

Please note that **the method is experimental**! It is close to scientific, but for now it is not. Moreover,
it hasn’t yet been tested for the reliability of the results (if at all possible). Finally, it can contain
bugs and leaks. Therefore, for the purity of the experiment:

- start generation, being in the area of a stable WiFi signal and / or mobile network, where serious interruptions
and interference are not expected. This also means the absence of extraneous aggressive radiation;
- do not take the results (especially the first ones) as the ultimate truth and do not react to them
too emotionally;
- in no case try to use violence against your device – it will do nothing but break it;
- share the results with colleagues and friends (the application has a built-in function) to understand
the correctness / incorrectness of the testing method.

In the current form of the method, ***an absence of positive results doesn’t mean anything***. However, ***their
presence relatively reliably shows some complex distortion of electromagnetic field***, which, even after
the generation algorithm, leaves a trace in its operation. That is, ***your ability to influence it***.

The test can be considered ***successfully passed*** if the slider on the main page is shifted to the
right by a noticeable distance (the scale will change its color to orange) for three or more seconds
in a row. This can happen as a result of a high degree of concentration on it, and under the influence
of strong emotions of a person who is near the device. Try different options – one of them may give
the desired effect.

### Conclusion

In general, go for it! We really have no idea what the results of this experiment will be. Therefore,
we hope for your feedback (comments on improving the method, results obtained, suggestions and bug
reports) and maximum participation. Good luck!
